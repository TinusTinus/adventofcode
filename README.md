# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

These solutions were written in Java.
I typically try to use the latest Java version,
to help me keep up-to-date with new language features.
Third-party dependency mangement is done using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).

I mostly attempt these puzzles for fun, not to actually compete on the leaderboard.
Although the point of the competition is to solve puzzles as quickly as possible,
I try to write readable and pretty well-documented code.
These solutions are intended to be somewhat easy to understand.

There is some code reuse between puzzles, for example for reading text from an input file,
and for functionality related to two-dimensional coordinates.
Each solution is accompanied by some unit test cases, based on examples
from the puzzle text, as well as the accepted answer for my puzzle input.
Github Actions are used to run these unit tests after every push to master.
