# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

These solutions were written in Java and Kotlin.
I typically try to use the latest language versions,
to help me keep up-to-date with new language features.
Third-party dependency management is done using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).
Github Actions are used to run unit tests after every push to master.

I mostly attempt these puzzles for fun, not to actually compete on the leaderboard.
