# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

I attempt these for fun and learning, not to actually compete on the global leaderboard.

Solutions have been written in Java and Kotlin.
Third-party dependency management is done using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org).
Github Actions are used to run unit tests after every push to master.
